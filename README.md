## Update: This app has served its purpose for us and is now offline. If the code or the idea is of interest to anyone, please feel welcome to work with it. You can contact me at @marcoherbst ##

This is an open source application written in Phoenix that allows monitoring & management of devices on the edge.

That includes:
+ NVRs (Hikvision or OnVIF)
+ Routers (Dovado & Teltonika)
+ SIMs (From Three (Ireland & UK))
+ Solar Controller (Victron MPTT)

Functionality includes:
+ Status Polling & Alerts
+ Graphical representation of Device Online / Offline status using [Visavail](https://github.com/flrs/visavail)
+ If This Then That functionality (e.g. If SIM usage is > X then Notify)

It is designed to be an extensible platform for system integrators to monitor client-side equipment.
