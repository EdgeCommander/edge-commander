This is an open source application written in Phoenix that allows monitoring & management of devices on the edge.

That includes:
+ NVRs (Hikvision or OnVIF)
+ Routers (Dovado & Teltonika)
+ SIMs (From Three (Ireland & UK))
+ Solar Controller (Victron MPTT)

Functionality includes:
+ Status Polling & Alerts
+ Graphical representation of Device Online / Offline status using [Visavail](https://github.com/flrs/visavail)
+ If This Then That functionality (e.g. If SIM usage is > X then Notify)

It is designed to be an extensible platform for system integrators to monitor client-side equipment.
